            "IO:O is the optical imaging component of the IO (Infrared-Optical) suite of instruments, and is a replacement for RATCam that has been the workhorse optical camera for many years. It provides a wider field of view and greater sensitivity than RATCam, and when combined with IO:I may eventually allow the ability to almost simultaneously image in both optical and near-infrared bands."
